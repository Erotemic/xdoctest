"""
Checks for got-vs-want statements

A "got-string" is data produced by a doctest that we want to check matches some
expected value.

A "want-string" is a representation of the output we expect, if the
"got-string" is different than the "want-string" the doctest will fail with a
:class:`GotWantException`. A want string should come directly after a doctest
and should not be prefixed by the three cheverons (``>>> ``).

There are two types of data that a doctest could "get" as a "got-string",
either the contents of standard out the value of an expression itself.

A doctest that uses stdout might look like this

.. code:: python

    >>> print('We expect this exact string')
    We expect this exact string

A doctest that uses a raw expression might look like this

.. code:: python

    >>> def foo():
    >>>     return 3
    >>> foo()
    3

In most cases it is best to use stdout to write your got-want tests because it
is easier to control strings sent to stdout than it is to control the
representation of expression-based "got-strings".
